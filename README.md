# Csharp-Data-Visualization
This repository is a collection of minimal-case example projects to display data with Visual Studio. Code here is mostly written in C# using [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) and only using free software and plugins.

* Each section below is an entirely standalone Visual Studio [solution](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b142f8e7.aspx) with a single [project](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b142f8e7.aspx).
* Projects get progressively more advanced (and more well-written) from bottom to top.

**[interactive pan and zoom](/projects/17-06-25_pan_and_zoom)** The [`ScottPlot` class](/projects/17-06-25_pan_and_zoom/swharden_demo/ScottPlot.cs) now has an advanced axis system. This makes it easily to set the viewing window in unit coordinates (X1, X2, Y1, Y2) and also do things like zoom and pan. This example was made to demonstrate these functions, as well as compare the speed of interactive graph manipulation at different sizes and with different quality settings. Although the GUI has many features, [Form1.cs](projects/17-06-25_pan_and_zoom/swharden_demo/Form1.cs) is not overwhelmingly complex. | ![](projects/17-06-25_pan_and_zoom/demo.gif)
**[stretchy line plot](/projects/17-06-24_stretchy_line_plot/)** In this demo some random points are generated and scrolled (similar to numpy's [roll](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.roll.html) method). Although the result looks simple, there is some strong thought behind how this example is coded. All the graphing code is encapsulated by the `ScottPlot` class of [swhPlot.cs](projects/17-06-24_stretchy_line_plot/pixelDrawDrag2/swhPlot.cs). The code of the GUI itself [Form1.cs](projects/17-06-24_stretchy_line_plot/pixelDrawDrag2/Form1.cs) is virtually empty. My thinking is that from here I'll work on the graphing class, keeping gui usage as simple as possible. _Note: plotting 321 data points I'm getting about 300Hz drawing rate with anti-aliasing off and 100Hz with it on_ | ![](/projects/17-06-24_stretchy_line_plot/demo.gif)
**[basic buffered line plot](/projects/17-06-24_buffered_line_plot)** graphs data by creating a bitmap buffer, drawing on it with `System.Drawing.Graphics` (mostly `DrawLines()`) with customizable pens and quality (anti-aliasing), then displaying it onto a frame. The frame is resizable, which also resizes the bitmap buffer. Screen updates are timed and reported (at the bottom) so performance at different sizes can be assessed. | ![](projects/17-06-24_buffered_line_plot/demo.gif)
