# Realtime Microphone FFT with ScottPlot

This project demonstrates how to plot microphone data (and its FFT) with [ScottPlot](https://github.com/swharden/ScottPlot). Previous versions of this project used earlier versions of ScottPlot (which are no longer supported).

### Creating this Project from Scratch
These are the steps I did to make this project
* I cloned [ScottPlot](https://github.com/swharden/ScottPlot) into [ScottPlot-2018-09-09/](ScottPlot-2018-09-09) so it will always work with this project even if the latest ScottPlot API changes.
* Add Project (ScottPlot.csproj) to the solution
* ScottPlotUC showed up in the toolbox, so I could drag/drop onto a form
*
