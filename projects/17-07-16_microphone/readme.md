# Realtime Graphing of Microphone Audio with FFT Display using C# (Visual Studio 2017)

![](demo.gif)

**Project Demo on YouTube:** https://youtu.be/q9cRZuosrOs
* See notes related to [calculating FFT with C#](/notes/FFT.md)
* **WHY THIS PROJECT EXISTS:** This is intended to be a minimal case example how to capture audio data from the microphone and display it in real time. It is not a polished project. It is essentially a note-to-self project uploaded to provide code reference for the author in the future. I'm sharing it online so others may benefit from reviewing its code.
* **ScottPlot** is a user control I am currently developing. It will be its own GitHub project when it is completed, but it's not ready yet. I'm adding a _zip snapshot_ of the current development project frozen in time. If you are going to try to run this project as-is, you'll need to add ScottPlot as a reference.
